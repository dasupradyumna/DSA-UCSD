# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization

This specialization is offered by **UC San Diego** on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)
and consists of 6 separate courses of increasing complexity and difficulty. Each course has its own
set of lectures and programming assignments.

1. [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
2. [Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
3. [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
4. [Algorithms on Strings](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-strings?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
5. [Advanced Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)
6. [Genome Assembly Programming Challenge](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assembling-genomes?specialization=data-structures-algorithms)

### Info

C++ files should be compiled with the following command:

```bash
g++ -pipe -O2 -std=c++11 "<filename>"
```

#### TODO

- [ ] Move stress testing function out of the main scripts
- [ ] Add multithreading to the testing process for speedup
